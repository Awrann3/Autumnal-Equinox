        </p> We are a cafe who specialise in keeping the heart and vibe of the Fall season,
        come from the flower frenzied spring into the resting amber of autumn once more.</p>

    </p> Miss the seasonal selections of most coffee shops? Don't fret, pumpkin spice, maple,
    caramel latte's and a whole lot more of our own original menu to show the love of the season!</p>
    
</p> That isn't all we have to offer! we also are an animal cafe, our lovely Shiba Inu's are sure to
spice up your day here like our coffees, allow them to lay by and watch the leaves fall as you enjoy
your beverage. </p>
